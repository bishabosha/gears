An Experimental Asynchronous Programming Library for Scala 3. It aims to be:
- **Simple**: enables direct-style programming (suspending with `.await`, calling Async-functions directly) and comes with few simple concepts.
- **Structured**: allows an idiomatic way of structuring concurrent programs minimizing computation leaking (*structured concurrency*), while
  providing a toolbox for dealing with external, unstructured events.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on JVM >= 21, Scala Native and Scala.js with WAsm support.

> [!WARNING]  
> On V8 <14.2.75 (Node.js 24 and 25), there is a bug that causes stack overflows in nested async contexts, which are used extensively by Gears. Use Node.js 26+, or another runtime with Wasm 3.0 and JSPI support.
> See #165 for more details.

## Getting Started

The [Gears Book](https://natsukagami.github.io/gears-book) is a great way to getting started with programming using Gears.
It provides a tutorial, as well as a guided walkthrough of all concepts available within Gears.

### Adding `gears` to your dependencies

With `sbt` 2:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.epfl.lamp" %% "gears" % "<version>"
```

For cross-platform dependencies with sbt 1, use `%%%`.

With `mill`:
```scala
def ivyDeps = Agg(
  // ... other dependencies
  ivy"ch.epfl.lamp::gears:<version>"
)
```

With `scala` (since 3.5.0) or `scala-cli`:
```scala
//> using dep "ch.epfl.lamp::gears:<version>"
```

## Setting up on an unpublished version of Gears

The build uses sbt 2 and Scala 3.9.0. You will need JDK >= 21 and [Scala Native](https://scala-native.org) set up, plus Node.js 26+ to run the Scala.js tests.
```bash
sbt publishLocal
```

## Scala Native async I/O demos

The `nativeAsyncioLoop` and `kqueueDemo` sbt projects were ported
from [bishabosha/scala-native-async-io@6e8320d](https://github.com/bishabosha/scala-native-async-io/commit/6e8320d36c71f75c9daf85065f5c89729f0825c0),
and extended with Unix datagrams and IPv4/IPv6 sockets. These low-level experiments
require kqueue and are tested on macOS.

Kqueue operations use `scala.scalanative.bsd.kevent` from Scala Native's `posixlib`,
including its native event size and get/set helpers. The original custom Scala/C
bindings and `nativeAsyncioCore` project are no longer needed. Scala Native 0.5.11
does not export `EVFILT_TIMER`, so the timer helper keeps that constant locally
and uses kqueue's default millisecond units.

```bash
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run timer'
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run target-info'
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run echo --msg hello'
```

For the FIFO demos, create a named pipe with `mkfifo /tmp/gears-demo.fifo`, then
run the reader and writer in separate terminals:

```bash
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run file-read --fifo /tmp/gears-demo.fifo'
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run file-write --fifo /tmp/gears-demo.fifo -m hello'
```

For Unix domain stream sockets, start the server first, then the client in another terminal:

```bash
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run sock-serve --sock /tmp/gears-demo.sock'
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run sock --sock /tmp/gears-demo.sock'
```

Unix domain datagrams preserve message boundaries and echo each packet to its
sender. The client binds its own path so the server can reply:

```bash
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run datagram-serve --sock /tmp/gears-datagram.sock'
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run datagram --sock /tmp/gears-datagram.sock --local-sock /tmp/gears-client.sock -m hello'
```

Use distinct client and server paths, and a different client path for each
concurrent client. Bound Unix paths are removed when their resource scope exits;
force-stopping a process can leave a path behind, which the next bind removes.

IPv4 (`AF_INET`) and IPv6 (`AF_INET6`) demos default to the numeric localhost
addresses `127.0.0.1` and `::1`. Start each server before its corresponding client:

| Transport | Address family | Server | Client |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TCP stream | IPv4 | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run sock4-serve --port 9999'` | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run sock4 --port 9999'` |
| TCP stream | IPv6 | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run sock6-serve --port 9999'` | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run sock6 --port 9999'` |
| UDP datagram | IPv4 | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run datagram4-serve --port 9999'` | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run datagram4 --port 9999 -m hello'` |
| UDP datagram | IPv6 | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run datagram6-serve --port 9999'` | `sbt 'kqueueDemo/run datagram6 --port 9999 -m hello'` |

`--host` overrides the numeric address; DNS names and IPv6 scope suffixes are not
resolved. Ports must be in `0..65535` (binding port `0` asks the OS to choose one).
UDP clients receive an ephemeral local port automatically. Datagram clients send
one packet, wait up to five seconds for socket readiness or a reply, and exit.
Empty datagrams are valid; there is no stream length header. The receive buffer is
64 KiB and truncation is reported as an error; the OS may impose smaller send limits.
Stream demos use a four-byte big-endian request length (up to 1 MiB) and close the
connection after replying.

The key-value demos are a pipelined request and response service in the style of
Redis, over the same length-framed protocol. The server keeps each connection open,
answers `SET key value`, `GET key`, and `INCR key` in order, and writes replies while
further commands are still arriving. The client pipelines a batch of `--count`
increments without waiting, reading the replies as they come back, so each socket has
a read and a write pending at the same time. `kv4` and `kv6` use IP addresses:

```bash
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run kv-serve --sock /tmp/gears-kv.sock'
sbt 'kqueueDemo/run kv --sock /tmp/gears-kv.sock --count 20000'
```

Stop the long-running servers with Ctrl+C. Use `sbt 'show kqueueDemo/nativeLink'`
to build and locate the executable for running directly.

The `kqueueDemoTests` project holds JVM munit suites that link the demo executable
and drive it as a subprocess with Java sockets and FIFOs. They check timer expiry,
FIFO read/write readiness, and all six socket combinations, including fragmented
stream requests, queued datagrams, empty packets, multiple senders, and invalid
addresses. Java has no Unix domain datagram sockets, so that case uses native
clients only. The suites skip themselves on other operating systems.

```bash
sbt kqueueDemoTests/test
```
