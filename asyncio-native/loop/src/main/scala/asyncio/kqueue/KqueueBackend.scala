/** Kqueue's reactors, with every capability a backend may have: IP, Unix stream and Unix datagram sockets, regular
  * files and name resolution on the blocker pool, pipes, readiness, blocking ops on blocker threads, and FIFOs. Kqueue
  * watches POSIX file descriptors, so a handle is the descriptor itself. The reactors all run the same ops, which keep
  * no state of one reactor between submissions, so an op may go to any of them in turn; what kqueue keeps about a
  * descriptor stays with the reactor that registered it.
