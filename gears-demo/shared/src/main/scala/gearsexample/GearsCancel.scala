/** Mirror of `example.KQueueExampleCancel`. Cancellation is just `Future.cancel()`: the bridge asks the reactor to
  * cancel the op, and the future is rejected when the reactor confirms through the completion's `onCancel`. Cancelling
  * in the reactor is also what frees the read slot for the fresh read afterwards. The reactor has no promise op here:
  * code written against `Reactor` uses gears promises, which do not involve the reactor.
